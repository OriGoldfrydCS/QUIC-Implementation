# QUIC with NewReno Congestion Control

This project is a simulation of the **QUIC protocol** combined with the **NewReno congestion control algorithm**. It emulates a real-world network environment to showcase how data packets are sent, received, acknowledged, and managed under varying network conditions such as delays, packet loss, and congestion. 

## Overview

The QUIC protocol is a transport layer protocol designed to improve the performance of internet applications by reducing latency and increasing throughput. This project implements:
- A **QUIC sender** that transmits packets to a receiver.
- A **QUIC receiver** that acknowledges packets and simulates network conditions like packet loss and delay.
- The **NewReno algorithm**, which is widely used for congestion control, adjusting the senderâ€™s behavior based on acknowledgment patterns and packet loss.

This implementation emphasizes how congestion control algorithms like NewReno can enhance the performance and reliability of QUIC.

## Features

### Protocol Simulation
- **Packet Transmission**: The QUIC sender sends data packets over a simulated network, and the receiver acknowledges them.
- **Congestion Control**: The NewReno algorithm dynamically adjusts the congestion window based on network feedback.

### Network Conditions
- **Packet Loss Simulation**: Randomly drop packets based on a configurable probability.
- **Variable Delays**: Simulate normal and extended delays to mimic real-world networks.
- **Persistent Congestion Detection**: Handle prolonged packet loss scenarios.

### Performance Analysis
- **RTT Tracking**: Measure and log the round-trip time (RTT) for every packet.
- **Congestion State Logging**: Record transitions between Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, and Recovery phases.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Generate plots for RTT trends, congestion window size, and state transitions.
